# Software

I have a keen interest in software development with regard to forest inventory systems.
I am currently developing and maintaining several packages for use in forest resource
analysis.

All of these packages are open source and free to use. If you are interested in
collaborating please to do not hesitate to reach me at any one of these 
[contacts](contact).

## Python

[pyfor](https://github.com/brycefrank/PyFor): A LiDAR processing package written
in the Python programming language.

[laxpy](https://github.com/brycefrank/laxpy): A small package for Python users
to access the spatial indexing (`.lax`) files generated by [LASlib](https://github.com/LAStools/LAStools/tree/master/LASlib).
This makes clipping `.las` files much more memory efficient.

## R

[spsys](https://github.com/brycefrank/spsys): A package that estimates the sampling variance for
two-dimensional systematic sampling designs that are frequently used in environmental and forestry
surveys.

[sptotal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sptotal/index.html): A package for estimating population totals of finite populations
of spatially correlated data. Developed in conjunction with Dr. Matthew Higham and Dr. Jay Ver Hoef.
