I have a keen interest in software development with regard to forest inventory systems.
I am currently developing and maintaining several packages for use in forest resource
analysis. These started as useful functions for me to use for my daily work, but quickly
flowered into full-blown projects.

All of these packages are open source and free to use. If you are interested in
collaborating please to do not hesitate to reach me at any one of these 
[contacts](contact). Those with experience in R, Python, Qt and (of course) git
development will be welcomed with open arms.

- [forvol](https://github.com/brycefrank/forvol): A tree volume equation library
written in the R programming language. forvol provides a flexible way for forest
inventory professionals to interact with FIA volume equations for various species.

This package is operable for many Pacific Northwest tree species, but still needs a lot of work in terms of adding volume equations and automated testing.

- [opencompile](https://github.com/brycefrank/opencompile): An open source forest
inventory data compiler in the R programming language. This is meant to serve as
a back-end package for a GUI cruise editing application.

This package is in a fledgling state and is in active development.

- [PyFor](https://github.com/brycefrank/PyFor): A LiDAR processing package written
in the Python programming language. 

This package is usable for small LiDAR tiles, but needs some re-working to be fully
performant for large scale use. Its development is currently in hiatus.
