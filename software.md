# Software

I have a keen interest in software development with regard to forest inventory systems.
I am currently developing and maintaining several packages for use in forest resource
analysis.

All of these packages are open source and free to use. If you are interested in
collaborating please to do not hesitate to reach me at any one of these 
[contacts](contact).

## Python

[pyfor](https://github.com/brycefrank/PyFor): A LiDAR processing package written
in the Python programming language.

[laxpy](https://github/com/brycefrank/laxpy): A small package for Python users
to access the spatial indexing (`.lax`) files generated by [LASlib](https://github.com/LAStools/LAStools/tree/master/LASlib).
This makes clipping `.las` files much more memory efficient.

## R

[forvol](https://github.com/brycefrank/forvol): A tree volume equation library
written in the R programming language. forvol provides a flexible way for forest
inventory professionals to interact with FIA volume equations for various species. 

[sptotal](https://github.com/highamm/sptotal): A package for estimating population totals of finite populations
of spatially correlated data. Developed in conjunction with Matthew Higham,
Dr. Jay Ver Hoef, and Dr. Francisco Mauro-Gutierrez (in development).

## Javascript

[sampling_viewer](https://github.com/brycefrank/sampling_viewer): An educational tool
for visualizing and teaching concepts in finite population sampling and inference. Written using
`d3.js`.
