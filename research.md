# Research

I am a PhD student at Oregon State University under the advisement of Temesgen Hailemariam in the [Forest Measurements and Biometrics Lab](http://fmbl.forestry.oregonstate.edu/).
My research interests revolve around LiDAR and remote sensing applications for large scale analysis of forest resources including the specifics:

- Statistical Methods
  - Small Area Estimation
  - Classification Methods
- Geospatial Data Processing

- Tree Detection Algorithms

Before graduate school I spent two years as a timber cruiser with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and have an interest in traditional forest measurement methods, tools,
and software. I am specifically interested in how field measurements affect the conclusions we can make using remote sensing assisted forest inventories.
