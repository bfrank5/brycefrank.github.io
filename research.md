# Research

I am a PhD student at Oregon State University under the advisement of Temesgen Hailemariam in the [Forest Measurements and Biometrics Lab](http://fmbl.forestry.oregonstate.edu/).
My research interests revolve around LiDAR and remote sensing applications for large scale analysis of forest resources. In particular:

- Small Area Estimation
- Uncertainty Assessment
- Applications for Non-Parametric Methods
