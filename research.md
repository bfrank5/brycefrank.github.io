# Research

I am a postdoctoral fellow working with the Forest Inventory and Analysis program. I recently
completed my PhD program under the advisement of Temesgen Hailemariam in the [Forest
Measurements and Biometrics
Lab](http://fmbl.forestry.oregonstate.edu/).
My research interests revolve around large scale analysis of forest resources. In particular:

- Utilization of Remote Sensing Data
- Small Area Estimation
- Uncertainty Assessment
- Sampling
