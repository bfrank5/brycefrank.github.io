## Background

I am a PhD candidate in the Forest Engineering, Resources and Management Department in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University. I am broadly interested in forest biometrics, with a specific affinity for remote sensing applications in large scale forest inventories. Although much of my work revolves around remote sensing and statistics, I am also interested in developing software that assists in the practice of forest biometrics.
