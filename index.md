## Background

I am a graduate student in the Forest Engineering, Resources and Management Department in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University. I am broadly interested in forest biometrics, with a specific affinity for remote sensing applications in large scale forest inventories. Although much of my work revolves around remote sensing and statistics, I am also interested in developing software that assists in the practice of forest biometrics.

## Current Projects

1. [forvol](https://github.com/brycefrank/forvol) - a tree volume equation library based in R

2. LiDAR Thinning Optimization - analysis of thinnable areas in Southwestern Oregon

3. opencompile - an open source forest inventory compiler
